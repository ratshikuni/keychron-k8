# Keychron K8 Reverse Engineering

This is partial and may or may not be completed.
Use this information at your own discretion and risk.

This is for K8 RGB v1.

## TODO List - QMK support
- [x] Ability to safely flash bootloader
- [x] Ability to revert to factory firmware
- [x] Confirm Chibios functionality
- [x] Get QMK Working
- [ ] Get LEDs working (currently very buggy, lots of flickering)
- [ ] Confirm bluetooth functionality

## Chips
* Main MCU - HFD2201KBA - appears to be based on/clone of [SONIX SN32F24xB](http://www.sonix.com.tw/article-tw-4315-30347)

## Bluetooth module
![k4-bluetooth-CYW20730.png](./img/K4-bt-CYW20730.png)

seems to be wired like the Blitzwolf BW-KB1(https://github.com/IslamAlam/blitzwolf-bw-kb-1)
